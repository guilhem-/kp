# CI workflow to publish the PoC to GitHub Pages
#
# After pushing to the default branch, the action creates/updates the
# special `gh-pages` branch and serves everything in the repository
# root (including kp.html, images, etc.).
#
# The published site will be reachable at:
#   https://<github-user>.github.io/<repository>/
#
# No build step is required â€“ we only upload the static files.
